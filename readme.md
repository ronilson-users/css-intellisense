![logo](https://i.ibb.co/xSmW5qv/logo-css-intellisense.png)

**Intellisense** is a plugin that provides autocomplete functionality for CSS classes and IDs in your code editor. It analyzes CSS and SCSS files in your project and offers autocomplete suggestions for classes and IDs when editing HTML files.

## Features

### 1. Autocomplete for Classes and IDs
- The plugin automatically detects classes and IDs defined in CSS and SCSS files within your project.
- Autocomplete suggestions appear as you type `class="` or `id="` in HTML files.

### 2. Support for CSS and SCSS Files
- Compatible with `.css` and `.scss` files.
- Recognizes nested SCSS classes, ensuring accurate and expanded suggestions.

## Examples

### Basic CSS Classes and IDs
Example of simple CSS classes and IDs for a button and a container:

```css
/* Basic CSS */
.button {
background-color: #4CAF50;
color: white;
padding: 10px 20px;
border: none;
border-radius: 5px;
}

.container {
width: 100%;
max-width: 1200px;
margin: 0 auto;
}

#main-title {
font-size: 24px;
color: #333;
}

/* Utility CSS */
.mt-1 { margin-top: 4px; }
.mt-2 { margin-top: 8px; }
.mt-3 { margin-top: 16px; }

.text-center { text-align: center; }
.text-bold { font-weight: bold; }
